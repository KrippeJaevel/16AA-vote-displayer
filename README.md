# 16AA-vote-displayer
Python script intended to render the votes for an event, and to display who has yet to vote.

It is currently set up to be run via a command line, but the intentions is to swap that for automatically render the votes for the current event.
This could be done by exchanging the "download guestlist" button with running this script, which ends up opening up the rendered file.
